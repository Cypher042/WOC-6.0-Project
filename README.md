# WOC-6.0-Project

This is my Project for Winter of Code 6.0 hosted by CyberLabs at IIT ISM Dhanbad

Its a malware that spys on the victims computer and provides realtime access to all the files in an organised manner. 

Run Victim.py on the Victim's system and run Attacker.py on your computer then you can use commands to access and navigate through the victim's computer and even download files form their system. Both the systems need to be on the same network.
